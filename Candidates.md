# Benchmarking-Free-AI Candidates.md

## Introduction
This document serves as the central candidate list for benchmarking fully free AI models accessible via their official websites. As of 05:39 PM +06 on Monday, October 20, 2025, candidates are selected based on strict criteria: 
- **100% free access**: No payments, subscriptions, or hidden fees for core functionality.
- **No limits**: Unlimited prompts/queries without daily/hourly caps, rate throttling, or usage tiers (e.g., no "20 messages/day" or "wait 24 hours for recharge").
- **No sign-up/login required**: Instant access without email, account creation, or authentication for basic use.
- **Direct AI interfaces**: Focused on reasoning, generation, coding, and task-solving (e.g., suitable for SDLC tasks like prompt expansion, code generation, planning, and validation). Excludes roleplay/character chats (e.g., no Perchance AI RP, Gening AI, or Character.AI alternatives from Reddit discussions).
- **Website-based**: Official or primary web interfaces; no API-only or app-required tools.

The list is curated from verified sources (e.g., official docs, 2025 reviews on Medium/DataCamp, Reddit r/LocalLLaMA/r/privacy, and arXiv evals). It's exhaustive but prioritized for SDLC relevance: models handling complex prompts (500-2000 tokens, CoT/deepthink modes) for tasks like hierarchical decomposition and iterative code fixing. Exclusions: ChatGPT/Grok/Claude (limits), Perplexity.ai (soft caps), QuillBot (limitations noted in docs).

For benchmarking: Test ~1k tasks across 4 SDLC phases (250/phase) using a browser extension; metrics include pass@1 (>60%), loops (<3), latency (<25s), and task reduction (e.g., >20% fewer fixes). Start with a balanced model as baseline.
